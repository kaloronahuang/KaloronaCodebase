# Kalorona's Codebase
This repo contains the codes I wrote in preparing and studying for the Olympiad in Informatics. Generally, I solve problems in following online judges:

luogu.org , HDU OJ, POJ, BZOJ(lydsy)

I am a beginner in this field. Hope people to find out my mistakes to help me improve myself.
